# Lazors-project
Software Carpentry Lazor Project

Group member: Dake Guo, Zijian Zhong, Yu Xu

This project aims to solve the Lazor game that is both available on the Android and IOS platform. The objective of the game is to move the blocks around to modify the path of the laser beam in order to pass the specified positions. 
The codes consist of a Lazor_Solver.py and a bunch of .bff files.
Lazor_Solver.py is the only code you will need to generate a solution for the game.
The detailed information about the Lazor games are stored in the .bff files. These .bff files contain different gaming levels.
A detailed description of the setup of the game is included in the mad_1.bff file. This file is used as an example in the Lazor_Solver.py to demonstrate one of the solutions of the Lazor game. 
To use Lazor_Solver.py to solve a Lazor game, simply change the file name inside the function of board_solver_process () to the name of the file to be solved. The Lazor game described in the file will be solved automatically, and a solution.txt will be generated to visualize the solved Lazor game.

Thank you and have fun playing the Lazor game!

Sincerely,
Dake Guo, Zijian Zhong, and Yu Xu
